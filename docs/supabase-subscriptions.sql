-- HelpmateAI subscriptions table.
--
-- Apply this in the Supabase SQL editor alongside docs/supabase-bootstrap.sql
-- and docs/supabase-quota-counters.sql. Adds the row that
-- `backend.subscriptions.get_active_subscription` reads from, which in
-- turn drives the Lemon Squeezy-powered `resolve_user_tier`.
--
-- One row per user. The webhook upserts on `processor_subscription_id`
-- and replaces the row's `user_id`/`tier`/`status` columns; the
-- application reads the row by user_id, which is the PK. Multi-seat
-- Business subscriptions (one LS subscription, many users) are out of
-- scope for v1 — when that ships, drop the `user_id PRIMARY KEY` and
-- add a separate `subscription_seats` table.
--
-- Same style as supabase-quota-counters.sql:
--   * RLS so users can read their own row.
--   * No client-side write policies — webhook writes via service_role.
--   * Service_role bypasses RLS so the FastAPI service can read on
--     every gate check without a JWT round-trip.
