"""Billing routes: Lemon Squeezy webhook + customer portal.

Two endpoints:

  * POST /webhooks/lemonsqueezy
        LS-delivered subscription event. Verifies the HMAC signature
        on the raw body, dispatches to
        `backend.webhooks.lemonsqueezy.process_webhook`. Returns 200
        on every signature-valid call (even when the event was
        skipped) so LS doesn't retry. 401 on signature mismatch,
        503 when the webhook secret env var isn't configured.

  * POST /billing/portal
        Authenticated. Calls the LS customer portal API to mint a
        one-time URL the frontend can window.location to. Returns
        503 when the LS_API_KEY env var isn't configured -- lets the
        integration ship to main without LS being live yet.

Pattern adapted from AI Job Agent's backend/routers/billing.py with
HelpmateAI-specific auth wiring -- this codebase uses the simpler
`require_authenticated_user` FastAPI dependency from backend.auth,
not the optional-token-and-context pattern.
