/**
 * CookieConsent — EU/ePrivacy-compliant cookie banner.
 *
 * Legal posture (the rule we're encoding):
 *   • Strictly-necessary cookies (Supabase Auth session, CSRF, and
 *     this consent-preference cookie itself) load regardless of
 *     consent. Allowed by ePrivacy Directive Art. 5(3) as "strictly
 *     necessary for the service the user requested." Storing the
 *     user's own consent choice is the textbook example.
 *   • Error tracking (Sentry, errors only — no Session Replay) loads
 *     regardless of consent. Legitimate interest under GDPR
 *     Art. 6(1)(f) — crash reporting to operate the service securely.
 *   • Everything else (PostHog product analytics, PostHog session
 *     replay, Sentry Session Replay) requires EXPLICIT opt-in.
 *
 * Persistence — a FIRST-PARTY COOKIE, not localStorage:
 *   The marketing site is the apex `helpmateai.xyz` (Next host
 *   rewrite → /landing) and the workspace is `app.helpmateai.xyz`.
 *   Those are different ORIGINS, so localStorage can't be shared —
 *   a user who consented on the landing was re-prompted on the app.
 *   We store the choice in a cookie scoped to the parent domain
 *   (`Domain=.helpmateai.xyz`) so BOTH hosts read the same value:
 *   consent given on either side is honored on the other, in either
 *   visit order. On any other host (localhost, *.vercel.app
 *   previews) we omit Domain so it's a host-only cookie — the
 *   browser would reject a `.helpmateai.xyz` cookie there anyway and
 *   there's no cross-subdomain story to support.
 *
 *   Cookie name `helpmate-cookie-consent`, values:
 *     (absent)   → "pending": banner shown, no analytics fired
 *     "accepted" → banner hidden, PostHog + Sentry Replay live
 *     "declined" → banner hidden, no analytics, no replay
 *
 *   A one-time read-fallback honors the OLD localStorage key so users
 *   who consented before this change aren't re-prompted on the origin
 *   they accepted on.
 *
 * Re-opening the choice: a footer link "Cookie preferences" calls
 * ``openCookiePreferences()`` which clears the cookie (back to
 * "pending") and dispatches a CustomEvent so the banner re-mounts. We
 * don't call ``location.reload()`` so workspace state is preserved.
 *
 * Why not Cookiebot/Iubenda/Termly:
 *   • Their pricing for our scale (~$11-27/mo) buys compliance theater
 *     dashboards we don't need
 *   • Their banners load third-party JS BEFORE the user has consented
 *     to third-party JS, which is its own compliance footgun
 *   • Our policy is simple: two categories ("essential" + "all"),
 *     two buttons. Building it ourselves is ~120 lines and gives us
 *     pixel control over the theme
